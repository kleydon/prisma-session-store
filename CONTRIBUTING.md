## Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- All public API methods **must be documented**.
- We use [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) to lint all code in this project.

  Please use Prettier for formatting.

## Commit Message Format

_This specification is inspired and supersedes the [AngularJS commit message format][commit-message-format]._

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted.
This format leads to **easier to read commit history**.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```txt
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and must conform to the [Commit Message Header](#commit-header) format.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits.
When the body is required it must be at least 20 characters long.

The `footer` is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters.

### Commit Message Header

```txt
<type>: <short summary>
  │            │
  │            └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │
  │
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|style|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory.

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

### Commit Message Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

Explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message should explain _why_ you are making the change.
You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate the impact of the change.

### Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.
